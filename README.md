# Word Rush
This is a high school independent study project. I am making this partly to learn Angular.js and Node.js, and partly to create a game which I have wanted to create for over a year. Previously, I simply did not have the knowledge to do so, but having learned Angular and Node, I can finally bring my idea to life.

## The Mission
This game is meant to be educational as well as entertaining. *Word Rush* encourages players to use the words they know to their advantage, and are rewarded for thinking of larger and more complex words. After each round, the game teaches the player a new word that fits the condition. It may be something you already know, but it also might be something that you come to use in your daily life!

## The Mechanics
In each round, you have to recall words that fit certain conditions. For example, you might have to write words that start with the phrase "TR" and contain at least 6 letters. The more complex your words are as well as the more words you actually write, the more points you will receive. This all must be done in a 1-minute timeframe.

The conditions for each round are randomly generated, and can contain any of the following, as well as a combination of them:
* Starts with a letter or phrase
* Ends with  a letter or phrase
* Contains a letter or phrase
* Contains a certain amount of letters

The accepted words are part of a static dictionary, so words such as "selfie" might be considered as wrong. However, there are over 3 million words in the dictionary used by *Word Rush*, so simply draw from your accumulated knowledge and you'll be fine!
