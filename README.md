# Word Rush
This is a high school independent study project. I am making this partly to learn Angular.js and Node.js, and partly to create a game which I have wanted to create for over a year. Previously, I simply did not have the knowledge to do so, but having learnt Angular and Node, I can finally bring my idea to life.

This game is meant to be educational as well as entertaining. Within a certain timeframe, the player has to recall words that meet certain conditions, such as starting with a phrase, containing a certain amount of a certain letter, or having a certain length. This game forces the player to use the words they know to their advantage, and are rewarded for recalling larger and more complex words.

Of course, the game gets more difficult as the player advances. More advanced and demanding conditions will be presented, testing the limits of the player's vocabulary. The game will also have the feature of teaching the players new words. This ensures the player improves with time.
